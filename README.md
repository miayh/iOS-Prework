# Prework - *Prework App*

Submitted by: **Mia Yamada-Heidner**

**Prework App** is an app that introduces Mia — her full name, where she goes to school, and what she hopes to do after graduating — and also features a cartoon picture of her. The background color will change to a randomly-selected color whenever the user clicks the "New Background Color" button. Additionally, upon clicking the text "Mia Yamada-Heidner", the color of that line of text will change to a random one. 

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total (3 hours learning Swift, 1 hour making the app)

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

Our brains make upward of 35,000 decisions daily, according to Eva Krockow, a lecturer at the University of Leicester who was featured in the CNN article "Decision fatigue drains you of your energy to make thoughtful choices. Here’s how to get it back". Knowing this, an app idea that I would like to build would be focused on turning decision-making fun and effortless. The app I have in mind would function like a magic-eight ball. For instance, it could be used to figure out what to wear in the morning by keeping track of outfits one has in their closet and then suggesting what to wear when the user interacts with the app (e.g. clicks a button, shakes the device, etc.). Another example could be helping one decide what to make to eat and/or where to eat out. The app could keep track of the user's favorite meals/restaurants and then choose where the user will eat.
